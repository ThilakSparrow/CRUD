# 🛍️ Product Management CRUD Application using JSP and HTML

## Description

This project is a simple Product Management CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using JSP (JavaServer Pages) and HTML. It allows users to manage product information in a MySQL database through a web interface. The project includes the following components:

- **📝 CreateProduct.html**: A web form for adding new products to the database.
- **📤 CreateProduct.jsp**: The server-side logic for processing and inserting product data into the database.
- **🖊️ EditProduct.jsp**: A form for editing existing product information.
- **🔄 UpdateProduct.jsp**: The server-side logic for updating product details in the database.
- **👁️ ViewProduct.jsp**: Displays product details based on a given product ID.
- **🗑️ DeleteProduct.jsp**: Allows the deletion of products from the database.
- **🏠 HomePage.jsp**: The main page displaying a list of all products with options to view, edit, or delete each product.

### Technologies Used

- JSP (JavaServer Pages) for server-side scripting.
- HTML for creating the web user interface.
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for connecting to and interacting with the MySQL database.
- MySQL as the database management system.
